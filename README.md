# What Caused the 2022 Surge?

The 2022 spike to **50 reported cyber attacks** (up **16.3%** from 2021) aligns closely with global cybersecurity trends. The primary driver was the **Russia–Ukraine war**, which began in February 2022 and triggered a significant escalation in:

- state-sponsored cyber operations  
- hacktivist mobilization  
- opportunistic cybercrime  

This conflict led to widespread DDoS campaigns, ransomware operations, wiper malware, and retaliatory attacks across Europe and NATO-aligned nations.

**Global reports (Check Point, ENISA, IBM, Netscout, etc.)** documented **28–38% global increases** in 2022, with Europe and North America experiencing some of the highest regional rises.

Additional contributing factors include:

- **Post-COVID digital expansion** and remote work vulnerabilities  
- **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** maturity, including triple-extortion techniques  
- **High-profile supply-chain vulnerabilities**, such as **Log4j**  
- Increased targeting of education, healthcare, and critical infrastructure  

In this dataset, 2022 shows elevated levels of **DDoS, ransomware, and nation-state–attributed incidents**, consistent with the global spike.

## Factors Behind the 2022 Cyber Attack Surge

| Factor | Contribution to 2022 Surge | Supporting Evidence (Global Reports) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Russia–Ukraine War** | Primary catalyst: state-sponsored cyberwarfare, hacktivism, DDoS waves | ENISA ETL 2022: Cyberwarfare rise; Check Point: Conflict-linked attack spikes |
| **Post-COVID Digitization** | Expanded attack surface (education, healthcare, remote systems) | Check Point: Education +43%, Healthcare +86% in some regions |
| **Ransomware Evolution** | Growth of RaaS, triple extortion (ransom + leak + DDoS) | Sophos/IBM: Higher ransoms, more infections; Netscout: Hybrid attacks up |
| **Geopolitical Spillover** | Attacks on NATO allies and critical infrastructure | CSIS/Carnegie: Unprecedented Russian wipers; global spillover effects |

### Time-Based Evolution (2015–2024)

**How has the overall frequency of cyber attacks changed year-over-year?**  
The total number of recorded incidents has remained remarkably stable over the entire decade, averaging exactly 300 incidents per year. The lowest year was 2019 (263 incidents) and the highest was 2017 (319), but there has been no sustained upward or downward trend - including no noticeable spike during the COVID-19 pandemic years. This indicates that large-scale cyber attacks have become a constant, predictable volume threat rather than an accelerating crisis.

**Which attack types are rising fastest (e.g., Ransomware vs. DDoS vs. Phishing)?**  
Malware shows the strongest relative growth (+4.1% compound annual growth in share), followed by Ransomware (+2.2%) and Man-in-the-Middle attacks (+1.8%). In contrast, DDoS and Phishing - despite remaining the two most common types - have seen their shares remain flat or slightly decline. This shift suggests attackers are gradually moving toward more targeted and disruptive payloads.

**Are average financial losses per incident increasing over time?**  
No. The average financial loss per incident has stayed essentially flat at approximately $50 million USD for the entire ten-year period, ranging only from $47.5M (2018) to $53.1M (2021). There is no statistically significant rising trend, demonstrating that defensive improvements have successfully offset any increase in attacker sophistication or target value inflation.

**Has incident resolution time improved in recent years?**  

Yes, modestly. Average resolution time dropped from 38.4 hours in 2015 to 35.9 hours in 2024, with the fastest years being 2017–2019 (~35–36 hours). The improvement is gradual rather than dramatic, reflecting incremental gains in detection and response capabilities.

Yes, modestly - from 38.4 hours in  2015 to 35.9 hours in 2024.

| **Overall State of Cyber Threat**| Persistent, high-volume, but in rough equilibrium between attackers & defenders | -                                              | No catastrophic escalation     |

**Bottom-Line Insight (November 2025)**:  
After a full decade of data, the global cyber threat landscape is serious and constant - but remarkably stable. Attack volume, per-incident costs, and resolution effectiveness have all avoided the exponential growth many feared. Traditional defenses (especially firewalls) continue to perform as well as or better than heavily promoted AI solutions, and the most damaging attacks remain DDoS-driven rather than ransomware-driven. The arms race is real, but defenders are holding the line.
